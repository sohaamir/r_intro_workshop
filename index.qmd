[Aamir Sohail](https://sohaamir.github.io/) is an MRC Advanced Interdisciplinary Methods (AIM) DTP PhD student based at the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH), University of Birmingham, where he is supervised by [Lei Zhang](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/zhang-lei) and [Patricia Lockwood](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/lockwood-patricia). He completed a BSc in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London, followed by an MSc in Brain Imaging at the University of Nottingham. He then worked as a Junior Research Fellow at the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics (CINN), University of Reading with [Anastasia Christakou](https://anastasia.christakou.org/). His research interests involve using a combination of behavioural tasks, computational modeling and neuroimaging to understand social decision-making, and using this knowledge to inform the precision-based treatment of mental health disorders. Outside of research, he is also passionate about facilitating inclusivity and diversity in academia, as well as promoting open and reproducible science.
