This website is an introduction to R, designed to be used as a course for students who are new to `R` and RStudio, assuming no prior programming experience[^1]:

[^1]: OpenAI (2025). Image created using ChatGPT (GPT4o) (https://chat.openai.com/). 5th May 2025.

In the course, students will learn basics of the R programming language, navigate RStudio and learn how to perform basic data analysis and visualization.

The course is designed for students with no prior programming experience, and will cover the following topics:
- Introduction to `R` and RStudio
- Data types and structures in `R`
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`
- Basic statistical analysis including t-tests and ANOVA
- Best practices for data analysis and reproducibility (e.g., using `git` and GitHub)

### Working with the course material 

The course is designed to be ran directly in the browser, using `webR`. This does not require any dependencies or software to be installed, and allows for changes to be made to the code directly in real time.

However, you can also choose to run the code directly in RStudio as well. To do this, please do the following (assuming you have `R`, `RStudio` and `git` installed): 

1. Clone the GitHub repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohaamir/r_intro_workshop.git
cd r_intro_workshop
```

2. Restore the `R` environment

```bash
renv::restore()
```

3. Open the `rmd` folder and run the scripts!

[Aamir Sohail](https://sohaamir.github.io/) is an MRC Advanced Interdisciplinary Methods (AIM) DTP PhD student based at the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH), University of Birmingham, where he is supervised by [Lei Zhang](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/zhang-lei) and [Patricia Lockwood](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/lockwood-patricia). He completed a BSc in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London, followed by an MSc in Brain Imaging at the University of Nottingham. He then worked as a Junior Research Fellow at the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics (CINN), University of Reading with [Anastasia Christakou](https://anastasia.christakou.org/). His research interests involve using a combination of behavioural tasks, computational modeling and neuroimaging to understand social decision-making, and using this knowledge to inform the precision-based treatment of mental health disorders. Outside of research, he is also passionate about facilitating inclusivity and diversity in academia, as well as promoting open and reproducible science.
